% Short paragraph to tie intro to abstract
The primal-dual technique was successfully applied to approximate NP-Hard problems in the 1990's.
In the early 2000's the application of the technique to online algorithms was discovered, and has since then been successfully used to solve many online algorithms \fred{Add refs}.
% Talk about how it allows you to specify online programs as offline linear programs that are then solved incrementally online using the technique.
% Solve program incrementally by successively adding in variables and constraints

% Buchbinder and Joseph's work
In 2009 Buchbinder and Joseph published a survey of the application of the primal-dual method to online algorithms.
The survey described the technique and then goes on to describe how it can be applied to solve a number of important online problems.
Since then the primal-dual method has been applied to solve additional standard problems in an online setting, such as the online version of the node-weighted steiner tree problem (see section \ref{steiner-tree}).
