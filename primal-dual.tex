In this section we will present the necessary background knowledge that is required to follow the discussion in later sections. We assume the reader is already familiar with the online algorithm model, competitive analysis, approximation algorithms, (integer) linear programming, randomized rounding and the concepts of weak and strong duality and will not review these concepts here. For a brief discussion of these concepts we refer the reader to section~2 of Buchbinder and Naor's survey~\cite{buchbinder09:survey}.
